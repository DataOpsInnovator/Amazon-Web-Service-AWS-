How to Generate SSH key and use it with my GitHub repository using VS CODE? My email is mefinealew@gmail.com. My repository name is Amazon-Web-Service-AWS. Show me the detailed steps.

To generate an SSH key and use it with your GitHub repository (Amazon-Web-Service-AWS) in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps:

1. Generate SSH Key
Open VS Code and use the terminal.

You can open the terminal from the top menu: Terminal > New Terminal.
In the terminal, enter the following command to generate a new SSH key. Replace the email with your GitHub email (mefinealew@gmail.com):

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mefinealew@gmail.com"

If your system doesn’t support ed25519, use rsa with:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "mefinealew@gmail.com"
When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default file location (~/.ssh/id_ed25519 or ~/.ssh/id_rsa).

Next, you'll be asked to create a passphrase. You can press Enter to skip creating one or enter a secure passphrase for added protection.

2. Add SSH Key to SSH Agent

Now that you've generated the SSH key, you'll need to add it to the SSH agent.

Start the SSH agent by running:

Start-Service ssh-agent (for perwershell) or

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"  (for Git bash)

Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

If you used RSA, replace id_ed25519 with id_rsa:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

3. Copy the SSH Public Key

You’ll need to add the SSH public key to your GitHub account.

Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard by running:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Or, if using RSA:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Highlight the entire output, starting with ssh-ed25519 (or ssh-rsa), and copy it.

4. Add SSH Key to GitHub

Go to GitHub and log in to your account.

In the top right corner of GitHub, click on your profile photo and then click Settings.

In the left sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.

Click the New SSH key button.

In the "Title" field, give your SSH key a descriptive name, such as 'VS Code SSH Key'.

In the "Key" field, paste the SSH public key that you copied earlier.

Click Add SSH key.

5. Configure Git to Use SSH
Next, configure Git to use SSH for your repository.

In VS Code, navigate to your repository folder (Amazon-Web-Service-AWS) or clone it using SSH:


git clone git@github.com:DataOpsInnovator/Amazon-Web-Service-AWS-.git


Set the remote URL for your repository to use SSH:


git remote add origin git@github.com:DataOpsInnovator/Amazon-Web-Service-AWS-.git


6. Test Your SSH Connection

To verify that everything is working, run this command to test your SSH connection:


ssh -T git@github.com

You should see a message like:

Hi DataOpsInnovator! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

7. Push Code to GitHub using SSH

Now you can push code changes using SSH in VS Code.

Make changes to your files.

Stage and commit the changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push the changes to GitHub:

git push origin main

That’s it! You’ve successfully set up SSH with your GitHub repository using VS Code. Let me know if you need further assistance.
